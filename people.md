## Current students
BSc and Erasmus students working on final year projects. Projects include investigating the impact of carbon monoxide on an avian model of development, and studying the effect of carbon monoxide on cerebrovascular markers of vascular disease in a population of smokers exposed to carbon monoxide long-term (in collaboration with Oxford Brookes University).

## Past PhD students
Emmanuel Debrah worked on cerebral mechanisms of breathlessness and its reliefs, with a particular focus on the role of the insula. He completed his PhD in Clinical Respiratory Physiology at Oxford Brookes University in 2016.

Anja Hayen worked on identifying brain mechanisms of dyspnoea in healthy volunteer models using functional magnetic resonance imaging. She completed her DPhil in Neuroscience at the University of Oxford in 2014. Anja now works as a senior scientist at P1Vital Ltd. 

## Collaborations
We work with the Moosavi lab at Oxford Brookes University on physiological and behavioural correlates of cigarette and e-cigarette smoking.
