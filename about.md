The Herigstad Lab is based in the Department of Biosciences and Chemistry at Sheffield Hallam University. Our research interests are on the effect of carbon monoxide and hypoxia on human physiology and pathophysiology development, and on perception of respiratory symptoms in cardiorespiratory disease.
