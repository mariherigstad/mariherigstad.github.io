Carbon monoxide and pathophysiology

Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that most of us breathe in every day through air pollution, and even small amounts of the gas have significant impact on cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular function. Worldwide, the World Health Organisation estimates that 4.2 million deaths per year occur due to air pollution, and we know that carbon monoxide air pollution is linked with increased incidence of vascular diseases, such as stroke and vascular dementia. However, we donâ€™t know precisely how low-level carbon monoxide exposure affects vascular health and contributes to pathophysiology. 

My research uses imaging (MRI and ultrasound) to probe the impact of carbon monoxide on vascular function. I use small doses of carbon monoxide to look at acute impact on blood flow and vascular reactivity, and models of chronic carbon monoxide exposure to look at long-term impact on vascular function. I am particularly interested in how carbon monoxide impacts nitric oxide synthesis and release, oxidative stress and inflammation, and how this may lead to development of pathophysiology.

Imaging respiratory disease

I am also interested in the development of functional and structural brain changes in chronic respiratory disease, in particular Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). COPD is caused by smoking or exposure to airborne pollutants, it is progressive and terminal, and the World Health Organisation estimates that it will be the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. In COPD, symptom perception is associated with both morbidity and mortality, and symptom processing and modulation are therefore important treatment targets. My research has combined MRI and behavioural data to determine patterns of neural processing in COPD patients, to identify targets for treatment optimisation and to assess the potential for patient stratification in this patient group.
