Our study on how low-level carbon monoxide exposure affects embryonic development has finished its first strage. The work was done in a model organism (chick), and eggs were exposed to various levels of carbon monoxide (added to the ambient air, from 1ppm to 25ppm). The work was student-led under the Erasmus+ scheme. Having finished data collection and analysis, we are in the process of writing up the results for publication, and also aim to conduct a few extra measurements to support our conclusions in collaboration with colleagues at the BMRC.
