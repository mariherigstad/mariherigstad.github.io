A big welcome to the newest research student in our lab, Megan Hird. She is working with the CO Research Group and Dr Nick Peake, looking at how we might measure CO exposure. 
This is a really exciting and challenging project, and we are pleased to have Megan working on it, as she did her undergraduate final year project with us as well.
