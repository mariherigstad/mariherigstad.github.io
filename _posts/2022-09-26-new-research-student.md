A big welcome to the newest research student in our lab, Josh Durrans. He started his work on low-level carbon monoxide impact on cardiac development using a chick model this week. This is a really exciting project that builds upon the findings outlined in Matias, F.R., Groves, I. & Herigstad, M. Impact of carbon monoxide on early cardiac development in an avian model. Biorxiv. doi: 10.1101/2021.12.22.473783. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.473783v1

Josh is working with a supervisor team consisting of Dr Liam Ridge, Dr Mari Herigstad and Dr Prachi Stafford, and he has previously done a successful undergraduate research project with Dr Liam Ridge on carbon monxoide.
