Our new PhD student, Simon Clarke, have started his work in the lab this week. He will be working on low-level carbon monoxide impact on cardiac development and cell function for his thesis. 
He is working with a supervisor team consisting of Dr Mari Herigstad, Dr Prachi Stafford and Prof Marysia Placzek (The University of Sheffield), and his PhD is funded by the Sheffield Hallam University GTA scheme.
We are really excited that he has joined our lab!
