Our new PhD student, Josh Durrans, have started his work in the lab this week. He'll be working on low-level carbon monoxide impact on the developing heart for his thesis. 
He is working with a supervisor team consisting of Dr Mari Herigstad, Dr Prachi Stafford, Dr Liam Ridge (Manchester Metropolitan University) and Marysia Placzek (University of Sheffield). 
His post is co-sponsored between the Sheffield Hallam University Transforming Lives scheme and the CO Research Trust, and we are particularly pleased to be partnering with the latter to offer Josh training in policy development, networking and impact. He will be the first student member of the medical subgroup advicing the All-Party Parliamentary CO Group. 
We are excited that he has joined our lab, and look forward to seeing the outcomes of his research.
