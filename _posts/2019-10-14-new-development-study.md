title: "New study: carbon monoxide effects on development"
date: 2019-10-14
---

We started a new study this week, looking at embryonic development and carbon monoxide exposure. We are doing this in a model organism - the chick. Avian models are highly useful for developmental studies due to their short developmental duration, the ease by which they may be manipulated in ovo, and the translucency of the skin up until very late stages of development. In this study, we are exposing developing chick embryos to carbon monoxide (added to the ambient air), to assess its impact on developmental markers. We are looking at various levels of carbon monoxide, from 1ppm to 35ppm.
