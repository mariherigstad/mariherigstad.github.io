title: "New study: Carbon monoxide effects on development"
date: 2019-10-14
---

We have started a new study this week, looking at how low-level carbon monoxide exposure affects embryonic development. The work is done in a model organism (chick). Avian models are useful for developmental studies due to their short developmental duration, the ease by which they may be manipulated in ovo, and the translucency of the skin up until very late stages of development. In this study, we are exposing developing chick embryos to various levels of carbon monoxide (added to the ambient air, from 1ppm to 25ppm), to assess its impact on developmental markers. We are particularly focused on cardiac development. 

The work is student-led and run in collaboration with researchers at the Bateson Centre (University of Sheffield).
