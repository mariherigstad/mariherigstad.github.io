New student projects starting next week
2020-02-19
We have three final year students coming to do research projects in the lab, starting next week. The students will be analysing fMRI data collected in a sample of healthy volunteers, looking at effects of a low dose of CO on the processing of reaction time tasks and brain regions associated with autonomic control. The projects will kickstart work on a sister publication to our 2019 open access JCBFM paper (Low-level carbon monoxide exposure affects BOLD fMRI), and we are excited to see the outcome of the analysis.
