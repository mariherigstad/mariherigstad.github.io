We have three final year students coming to do research projects in the lab, starting next week. The students will be analysing fMRI data collected in a sample of healthy volunteers, looking at effects of a low dose of CO on the processing of reaction time tasks and brain regions associated with autonomic control. The projects will kickstart work on a sister publication to our 2019 open access JCBFM paper (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0271678X19887358">Low-level carbon monoxide exposure affects BOLD fMRI</a>, and we are excited to see the outcome of the analysis.
