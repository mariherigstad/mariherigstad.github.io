We have a new project coming up, titled “A novel method for researching the role of CO in human diseases”, in collaboration with Dr Prachi Stafford at Sheffield Hallam University. 

The project is funded by the Gas Safety Trust and will commence as soon as lockdown is eased. It aims to develop a new method for efficiently studying CO exposures over time in human cell lines and model organisms. We're excited to have got the funds to develop this, as we believe it will be highly useful for the extension of CO research into new areas of science.
