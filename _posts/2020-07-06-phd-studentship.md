Do you want to do a PhD? We have an exciting upcoming opportunity for a student to do a PhD in our lab. The PhD project will be looking at impact of carbon monoxide on the brain using techniques such as MRI and ultrasound. The advert for the position will be placed shortly, and anyone interested in the project is encouraged to get in touch with me (m.herigstad@shu.ac.uk).
