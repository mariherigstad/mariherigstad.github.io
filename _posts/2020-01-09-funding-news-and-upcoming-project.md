We have a new project coming up, titled "The impact of low-level carbon monoxide on the human brain". The project is funded by the Gas Safety Trust, will commence in March 2020, and is a three-year project using several imaging modalities to investigate how carbon monoxide impacts the brain acutely and over time.
