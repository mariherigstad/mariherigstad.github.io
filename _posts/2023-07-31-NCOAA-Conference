Members of the group presented our research in three invited talks at the first ever NCOAA safety summit, held in Wilmington, North Carolina. It was a multidisciplinary conference, with presenters from academia, industry and public bodies, and our panel, chaired by CO Research Trust CEO, Adrian McConnell was well received. The presentations can be found here: <a href="https://www.coalition.ncoaa.us/summit-resource-library-2023">https://www.coalition.ncoaa.us/summit-resource-library-2023</a>.
