We welcome two new members to the group this month. 

Dr Elsie Place is a Research Fellow and will be working on the impact of carbon monoxide on the developing brain. Dr Place comes to us from the Placzek lab at the University of Sheffield, and is a highly experienced researcher. We are thrilled to have her on board for this project. Her post is funded by the CO Research Trust. 

Our new PhD student, Josh Durrans, have started his work in the lab this week. He'll be working on low-level carbon monoxide impact on the developing heart for his thesis, and his supervisory team consists of Dr Mari Herigstad, Dr Prachi Stafford, Dr Liam Ridge and Prof Marysia Placzek. His post is co-sponsored between the Sheffield Hallam University Transforming Lives scheme and the CO Research Trust, and we are particularly pleased to be partnering with the latter to offer Josh training in policy development, networking and impact.
