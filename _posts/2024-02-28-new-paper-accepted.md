We have a new paper accepted, titled "Carbon monoxide affects early cardiac development in an avian model" in Birth Defects Research.

The full paper is still in press, and describes how low-level carbon monoxide can change how the heart of the embryo develops, causing remodelling of the ventricular wall, atrial wall and ventricular septum. 

Carbon monoxide levels in this study was 4ppm, 9ppm and 18ppm, all of which are well within exposure levels that people can have on a daily basis, albeit briefly, just by walking next to a busy road. 

The work was supported by the Erasmus programme, the CO Research Trust and Kane Ltd.
