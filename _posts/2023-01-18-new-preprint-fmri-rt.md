We have a new preprint out from our group. The paper "Impact of carbon monoxide on neural activation during a reaction time task" outlines our most recent findings on the effects of low-level carbon monoxide on brain function in healthy human volunteers. You can find the paper on Biorxiv:

Wilson, L.A. & Herigstad, M. Impact of carbon monoxide on neural activation during a reaction time task. Biorxiv. doi: 10.1101/2023.01.17.524443. [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.473783v1

Lucie's work is co-sponsored between the Sheffield Hallam University GTA scheme and the CO Research Trust.
