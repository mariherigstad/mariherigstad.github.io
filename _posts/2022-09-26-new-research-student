A big welcome to the newest research student in our lab, Josh Durrans. He started his work on low-level carbon monoxide impact on cardiac development using a chick model this week. 
Josh is working with a supervisor team consisting of Dr Liam Ridge, Dr Mari Herigstad and Dr Prachi Stafford, and he has previously done a successful undergraduate research project with Dr Liam Ridge on carbon monxoide.
