Members of the group have attended and presented at several conferences and seminars over the year. 

At the annual CO Research Trust conference, held in Birmingham (UK), we had several members attending, and Josh Durrans was leading on publicising the new CO Research Network (CORN). This is part of his PhD work, which is undertaken in collaboration with CORT, and an important part in bringing the CO research community together.  

Dr Mari Herigstad presented ongoing research in an invited, recorded talk to the NCOAA safety summit (Kansas, USA). The talk was focused on CO and disease development and spanned both animal models and cell models. Dr Herigstad also presented our most recent paper in a panel at BioMedEng2024, held at Queen Mary University (London). She also presented analysis of work done in collaboration with Improving Performance in Pratice (IPIP) to their stakeholders, which led to collaboration on an upcoming manuscript (in preparation for submission) in March. 

We furthermore had the pleasure of attending and presenting at a collaborative meeting in Leeds earlier in the year, as well as hosting CORT at a seminar at SHU in November. In the November seminar, most members of the lab, including new members and MSc students, presented their ongoing work.
