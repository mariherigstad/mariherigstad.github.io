title: "New project: embryonic heart development and micro CT"
date: 2023-01-14

We have a new project starting this month, looking at how low-level CO effects heart development in a model organism, using micro CT. This is a really exciting project and we are very pleased to have a new research student on board to work on it. The research is a continuation of our ongoing work, looking at CO impact on cardiac congenital disease.

This research is undertaken in collaboration with Dr Liam Ridge and Dr Nicola Aberdein, both at the BMRC. Dr Ridge is an experienced developmental biologist and Dr Aberdein has significant expertise working with micro CT.
