Our new PhD student, Lucie Wilson, have started her work in the lab this week. She'll be working on low-level carbon monoxide impact on the human brain for her thesis. 
She is working with a supervisor team consisting of Dr Mari Herigstad, Dr Caroline Dalton (reader in Neuroscience and Genetics, Sheffield Hallam University) and Paul Armitage (lecturer in MRI Physics, The University of Sheffield). 
Her post is co-sponsored between the Sheffield Hallam University GTA scheme and the Gas Safety Trust research project funding.
We are excited that she has joined our lab, and look forward to seeing the outcomes of her research.
