We have a major new project coming up, titled “The effects of low-level CO on the adult and developing brain”, funded by the CO Research Trust. This is a ~£615k project that will employ one postdoctoral researcher and one PhD student to work on the impact of very low levels of CO on the brain.

We are excited to be working with collaborators at The University of Sheffield (Professor Marysia Placzek) and The University of Newcastle (Dr Chris Morris) as well as toxicologist Isabella Myers and internal collaborators Dr Prachi Stafford and Dr Liam Ridge for this major project.
