We have a new MRes student, Chloe Stephenson-Deakin, starting her work on low-level CO effects on oral/lung cells. 
Her research is undertaken in collaboration with Dr Prachi Stafford, holding significant experience on these cell lines. 
We are excited to see the outcome of Chloe's work.

We also have two new MSci students starting their work in the lab, working on assessing recent spatial and temporal changes in ambient CO in the UK.
