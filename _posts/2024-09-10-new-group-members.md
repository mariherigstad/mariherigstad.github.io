We'd like to welcome new members in the group:

We are delighted to have Dr Duncan Garner join the group as a Research Fellow, working on the impact of CO on the developing brain. He has extensive experience in the use of model organisms and will be using an avian model as well as cell models for his research. 

Megan Hird is a new PhD student working on the impact of CO on the adult brain, using both cell lines and a human model in her work. She has previously worked extensively on CO impact on health, and we are thrilled to have her join us for her PhD. 

Tryphine Gumbo and Tabitha Stutely have joined us as MSci students, both working on various aspects of CO on health for this academic year. Tryphine has done previous work on CO, which led to her presenting her undergraduate work at an external conference, and her research will expand upon existing work in our group. Tabitha is co-supervised by Dr Ines Ramos-Harrington on a really exciting new arm for CO research, which to our knowledge has not been explored before.
