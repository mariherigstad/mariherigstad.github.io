Do you want to do a PhD? We have an exciting upcoming opportunity for a student to do a PhD in our lab. 
The PhD project will be looking at impact of carbon monoxide on cellular pathways and embryonic development, and you will be taught how to use a range of laboratory techniques, including developing and working with 3D tissues. 

The advert for the position is here: https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/effects-of-low-levels-of-co-on-cellular-function-and-development/?p143145

Anyone interested in the project is encouraged to get in touch with me (m.herigstad@shu.ac.uk).
