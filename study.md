We would like to invite you to take part in a research study. Before you decide to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve for you. Before you decide to take part, you will be given an information participant sheet. You can request a sheet and information from the study team without signing up for the study. If you have any questions or want an information sheet, please contact either: 
Lucie Wilson - c0050720@my.shu.ac.uk
or 
Dr Mari Herigstad - M.herigstad@shu.ac.uk

**Who can take part?**
We are looking for fit and healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 who have either never smoked or have smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day for at least 3 years and can safely undertake an MRI scan. We ask that female participants are currently on a method of hormonal contraception, such as the oral contraceptive pill. 

**Why are we doing the study?**
Most individuals are exposed to carbon monoxide every day, often through car pollution, machinery that burns fossil fuels and through smoking. We know that this exposure, if it goes on for months or years, can have long-term effects on the body, but we donâ€™t yet understand if these effects can be reduced or reversed with different actions. Previous studies have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans) and transcranial doppler ultrasounds (TCDs) to look at the way the brain works. We would like to look at how very low levels of carbon monoxide, similar to what you are exposed to typically, may affect MRI and TCD scan results.
